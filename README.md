workshop to create a repository

## Homepage

description: my attempt at a basic webpage

Welcome to my homepage. I'm not sure how this is supposed to go but I'm going with my instinct. I've asked Manny's help and he's put me through.

## Body

This is the first website I'm creating using VScode. It's not exactly a website, more precisely, content that could fit on a website.

## Footer

created in April 2025.
